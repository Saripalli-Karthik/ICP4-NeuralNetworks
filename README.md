# ICP4-NeuralNetworks
This repo contains code for icp4 assigment which is Deep Learning Image Classification with CNN.I have used different layers in this cnn model like convolutional,dropout,maxpooling,flatten layer to built the model which is used for image classification using cifar10 dataset in keras and also it has code to illustrate the actual and predicted images and plot of accuracy and loss.
